# sudokuSolver
Wrote a C program that implements a simple Sudoku solver. Sudoku is a simple logic puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid of cells with each cell containing a number from the set 1-9 while fulfilling the following constraints: Each number is unique in its row and column. Each number is unique in its subgrid where a subgrid is defined by cutting the 9x9 into 9 non- overlapping 3x3 grids (top left, top, top right, left, middle, right, bottom left, bottom, bottom right). Each row, column, and subgrid have all numbers from 1-9 present. A Sudoku is defined as solved when all of its cells in the 9x9 grid are filled with numbers with each cell satisfying the constraints above. A Sudoku is defined as unsolvable when there is no configuration where all the cells can be filled without breaking the constraints. A Sudoku will start partially completed with some numbers placed in the 9x9 grid.
